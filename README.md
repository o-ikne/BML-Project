# Bayesian-Machine-Learning-Project

### 1. Overview
This [project](https://github.com/rbardenet/bml-course/blob/m2-lille/projects/papers.pdf) is part of the lecture on *Bayesian Machine Learning* tought by [RÉMI BARDENET](https://rbardenet.github.io/). The idea is to pick a paper from a list of given papers, and read it with a critical mind. For instance, we will:
- (1) explain the contents of the paper
- (2) emphasize the strong and weak points of the paper
- (3) apply it to real data of our choice when applicable.

This project is done by Zakaria Boulkhir \& me. For more insights check out our report.
